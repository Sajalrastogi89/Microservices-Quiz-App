## Architecture

![Architecture](https://your-image-link.com)

The application is composed of three main services:
1. **Quiz Service**: Manages quizzes.
2. **Question Service**: Handles questions associated with quizzes.
3. **API Gateway**: Provides a unified interface for clients and handles request routing.

### Features

- **Load Balancer**: Ensures even distribution of incoming requests across multiple service instances to improve performance and reliability.
- **Service Registry (Eureka Server)**: Manages the registration and discovery of services, allowing for dynamic scaling and better service management.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all services, managing requests and providing a security layer.
- **Spring Cloud**: Utilizes Spring Cloud features for seamless integration of microservices, enabling easy configuration, monitoring, and management.
- **Inter-Service Communication (Feign Client)**: Simplifies the inter-service communication, making it easier to call other services using HTTP.
- **Eureka Client**: Registers services with the Eureka Server for discovery by other services.
- **Eureka Server**: Hosts the service registry, enabling services to find each other.
